# Titanic Dataset Analysis
Welcome to the Titanic Dataset Analysis project! This repository contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling using the famous Titanic dataset. Dive into the world of the Titanic's passengers, uncover patterns, and build predictive models to understand factors influencing survival.

## Disclaimer

This dataset and the analysis conducted in this project are intended solely for educational and exercise purposes as part of my coursework at Purwadhika Data Science Bootcamp. The goal is to practice data exploration, analysis, and classification model development to enhance skills in data science and machine learning. Any insights, findings, or models presented here should not be considered authoritative or used for decision-making in real-world scenarios. The dataset itself is publicly available and has been utilized here for educational purposes only.

## About the Project

The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In this project, we explore passenger demographics, cabin classes, and survival outcomes. We also build predictive models to understand the factors affecting survival during that historic voyage.

## Dataset

We use the famous Titanic dataset from seaborn.

## Predictive Modeling

We've built predictive models to understand the factors influencing survival on the Titanic.

Happy exploring and analyzing the Titanic dataset!
