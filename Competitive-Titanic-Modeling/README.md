# Titanic Decision Tree Modeling Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Titanic Decision Tree Modeling project! This project is part of my training in data science and machine learning, using the competitive Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal of this project is to predict passenger survival on the Titanic based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including features like age, gender, ticket class, and more. The dataset is divided into a training set (used for model training) and a test set (used for making predictions).

## Project Highlights

- **Data Preprocessing:** We handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare the data for modeling.

- **Decision Tree Modeling:** We build a Decision Tree classifier to predict passenger survival based on the selected features.

- **Model Evaluation:** We evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.
