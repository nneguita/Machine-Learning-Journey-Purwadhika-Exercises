# Diabetes Risk Prediction
Disclaimer: This repository has been created for exercise purposes during my bootcamp at Purwadhika. It exclusively focuses on numerical regression modeling and does not involve algorithmic correctness testing.

## About the Dataset
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes,
based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed
on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females
at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
This dataset is tailored for diabetes risk prediction. It includes key health attributes such as pregnancy history, blood glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, diabetes hereditary factors, age, and a binary outcome (1 for positive diagnosis, 0 for negative). Researchers can use these attributes to build predictive models for early diabetes detection, helping individuals assess their risk based on health parameters and demographic data.

## Purpose
- This project aims to explore the relationship between various health attributes, such as age, glucose levels, BMI, and more, and the likelihood of diabetes development.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and relationships within the data.
- Building predictive models to assess the risk of diabetes based on health parameters.
- Custom functions for data visualization and interpretation.
- Continuous updates and improvements to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Contributions
- Contributions, feedback, and collaborations from the open-source community are welcome. Together, we can refine and expand the project's capabilities.

## Usage
- You can use the provided Jupyter notebooks to explore the dataset, visualize key insights, and run diabetes risk prediction models.

Let's work together to enhance our understanding of diabetes risk prediction and make a positive impact on health outcomes.
